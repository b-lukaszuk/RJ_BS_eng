# Comparisons - continuous data {#sec:compare_contin_data}

OK, we finished the previous chapter with hypothesis testing and calculating probabilities for binomial data (`bi` - two `nomen` - name), e.g. number of successes (wins of Peter in tennis).

In this chapter we are going to explore comparisons between the groups containing data in a continuous scale (like the height from @sec:statistics_normal_distribution).

## Chapter imports {#sec:compare_contin_data_imports}

Later in this chapter we are going to use the following libraries

```jl
s = """
import CairoMakie as Cmk
import Distributions as Dsts
import HypothesisTests as Htests
import Statistics as Stats
"""
sc(s)
```

Make sure you have them installed on your system. A reminder of how to deal (install and such) with packages can be found [here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/).

The imports will be in in the code snippet when first used, but I thought it is a good idea to put them here, after all imports should be at the top of your file (so here they are at top of the chapter). Moreover, that way they will be easier to find all in one place.

## One sample Student's t-test {#sec:compare_contin_data_one_samp_ttest}

Imagine that in your town there is a small local brewery that produces quite expensive but super tasty beer. You like it a lot, but you got an impression that the producer is not being honest with their customers and instead of the declared 500 [mL] of beer per bottle, he pours a bit less. Still, there is little you can do to prove it. Or can you?

You bought 10 bottles of beer (ouch, that was expensive!) and measured the volume of fluid in each of them. The results are as follows

```jl
s = """
# a representative sample
beerVolumes = [504, 477, 484, 476, 519, 481, 453, 485, 487, 501]
"""
sc(s)
```

On a graph the volume distribution looks like this (it was drawn with [Cmk.hist](https://docs.makie.org/stable/examples/plotting_functions/hist/index.html#hist) function).

![Histogram of beer volume distribution for 10 beer.](./images/histBeerVolume.png){#fig:histBeerVolume}

You look at it and it seems to resemble a bit the bell shaped curve that we discussed in the @sec:statistics_normal_distribution. This makes sense. Imagine your task is to pour let's say 1'000 bottles daily with 500 [mL] of beer in each with a big mug. Most likely the volumes would oscillate around your goal volume of 500 [mL], but they would not be exact. Sometimes in a hurry you would add a bit more, sometimes a bit less (you could not waste time to correct it). So it seems like a reasonable assumption that the 1'000 bottles from our example would have a roughly bell shaped (aka normal) distribution of volumes around the mean.

Now you can calculate the mean and standard deviation for the data

```jl
s = """
import Statistics as Stats

meanBeerVol = Stats.mean(beerVolumes)
stdBeerVol = Stats.std(beerVolumes)

(meanBeerVol, stdBeerVol)
"""
sco(s)
```

Hmm, on average there was `jl meanBeerVol` [mL] of beer per bottle, but the spread of the data around the mean is also considerable (sd = `jl round(stdBeerVol, digits=2)` [mL]). The lowest value measured was `jl minimum(beerVolumes)` [mL], the heighest value measured was `jl maximum(beerVolumes)` [mL]. Still, it seems that there is less beer per bottle than expected but is it enough to draw a conclusion that the real mean in the population of our 1'000 bottles is â‰ˆ `jl round(meanBeerVol, digits=0)` [mL] and not 500 [mL] as it should be? Let's try to test that using what we already know about the normal distribution (see @sec:statistics_normal_distribution), the three sigma rule (@sec:statistics_intro_three_sigma_rule) and the `Distributions` package (@sec:statistics_intro_distributions_package).

Let's assume for a moment that the true mean for volume of fluid in the population of 1'000 beer bottles is `meanBeerVol` = `jl meanBeerVol` [mL] and the true standard deviation is `stdBeerVol` = `jl round(stdBeerVol, digits=2)` [mL]. That would be great because now, based on what we've learned in @sec:statistics_intro_distributions_package we can calculate the probability that a random bottle of beer got >500 [mL] of fluid (or % of beer bottles in the population that contain >500 [mL] of fluid). Let's do it

```jl
s = """
import Distributions as Dsts

# how many std. devs is value above or below the mean
function getZScore(mean::Real, sd::Real, value::Real)::Float64
	return (value - mean)/sd
end

expectedBeerVolmL = 500

fractionBeerLessEq500mL = Dsts.cdf(Dsts.Normal(),
	getZScore(meanBeerVol, stdBeerVol, expectedBeerVolmL))
fractionBeerAbove500mL = 1 - fractionBeerLessEq500mL

fractionBeerAbove500mL
"""
sco(s)
```

I'm not going to explain the code above since for reference you can always check @sec:statistics_intro_distributions_package. Still, under those assumptions roughly 0.23 or 23% of beer bottles contain more than 500 [mL] of fluid. In other words under these assumptions the probability that a random beer bottle contains >500 [mL] of fluid is 0.23 or 23%.

There are 2 problems with that solution.

**Problem 1**

It is true that the mean from the sample is our best estimate of the mean in the population (here 1'000 beer bottles poured daily). However, statisticians proved that instead of the standard deviation from our sample we should use the [standard error of the mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error). It describes the spread of sample means around the true population mean and it can be calculated as follows

$sem = \frac{sd}{\sqrt{n}}$, where

sem - standard error of the mean

sd - standard deviation

n - number of observations in the sample

\
Let's enclose it into Julia code

```jl
s = """
function getSem(vect::Vector{<:Real})::Float64
	return Stats.std(vect) / sqrt(length(vect))
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Now we get a better estimate of the probability

```jl
s = """
fractionBeerLessEq500mL = Dsts.cdf(Dsts.Normal(),
	getZScore(meanBeerVol, getSem(beerVolumes), expectedBeerVolmL))
fractionBeerAbove500mL = 1 - fractionBeerLessEq500mL

fractionBeerAbove500mL
"""
sco(s)
```

Under those assumptions the probability that a beer bottle contains >500 [mL] of fluid is roughly 0.01 or 1%.

So, to sum up. Here, we assumed that the true mean in the population is our sample mean ($\mu$ = `meanBeerVol`). Next, if we were to take many small samples like `beerVolumes` and calculate their means then they would be normally distributed around the population mean (here $\mu$ = `meanBeerVol`) with $\sigma$ (standard deviation in the population) = `getSem(beerVolumes)`. Finally, using the three sigma rule (see @sec:statistics_intro_three_sigma_rule) we check if our hypothesized mean (`expectedBeerVolmL`) lies within roughly 2 standard deviations (here approximately 2 `sem`s) from the assumed population mean (here $\mu$ = `meanBeerVol`).

**Problem 2**

The sample size is small (`length(beerVolumes)` = `jl length(beerVolumes)`) so the underlying distribution is quasi-normal. It is called a [t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) (for comparison of an exemplary normal and t-distribution see the figure below). Therefore to get a better estimate of the probability we should use the distribution.

![Comparison of normal and t-distribution with 4 degrees of freedom (df = 4).](./images/normDistTDist.png){#fig:normDistTDist}

Luckily our `Distributions` package got the t-distribution included (see [the docs](https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/univariate/#Distributions.TDist)). As you remember the normal distribution required two parameters that described it: the mean and the standard deviation. The t-distribution requires [degrees of freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)). The concept is fairly easy to understand. Imagine that we recorded body masses of 3 people in the room: Paul, Peter, and John.

```jl
s = """
peopleBodyMassesKg = [84, 94, 78]

sum(peopleBodyMassesKg)
"""
sco(s)
```

As you can see the sum of those body masses is `jl sum(peopleBodyMassesKg)` [kg].
Notice however that only two of those masses are independent or free to change. Once we know any two of the body masses (e.g. 94, 78) and the sum: `jl sum(peopleBodyMassesKg)`, then the third body mass must be equal to `sum(peopleBodyMassesKg) - 94 - 78` = `jl sum(peopleBodyMassesKg) - 94 - 78` (it is determined, it cannot just freely take any value). So in order to calculate the degrees of freedom we type `length(peopleBodyMassesKg) - 1` = `jl length(peopleBodyMassesKg) - 1`. Since our sample size is equal to `length(beerVolumes)` = `jl length(beerVolumes)` then it will follow a t-distribution with `length(beerVolumes) - 1` = `jl length(beerVolumes) - 1` degrees of freedom.

So the probability that a beer bottle contains >500 [mL] of fluid is

```jl
s = """
function getDf(vect::Vector{<:Real})::Int
	return length(vect) - 1
end

fractionBeerLessEq500mL = Dsts.cdf(Dsts.TDist(getDf(beerVolumes)),
	getZScore(meanBeerVol, getSem(beerVolumes), expectedBeerVolmL))
fractionBeerAbove500mL = 1 - fractionBeerLessEq500mL

fractionBeerAbove500mL
"""
sco(s)
```
> **_Note:_** The z-score (number of standard deviations above the mean) for a t-distribution is called t-score or t-statistics (it is calculated with sem instead of sd).

Finally, we got the result. Based on our representative sample (`beerVolumes`) and the assumptions we made we can see that the probability that a random beer contains >500 [mL] of fluid (500 [mL] is stated on a label) is `fractionBeerAbove500mL` = 0.022 or 2.2% (remember, this is one-tailed probability, the two-tailed probability is 0.022 * 2 = 0.044 = 4.4%).

Given that the cutoff level for $\alpha$ (type I error) from @sec:statistics_intro_errors is 0.05 we can reject our $H_{0}$ (the assumption that 500 [mL] comes from the population with the mean approximated by $\mu$ = `meanBeerVol` = `jl meanBeerVol` [mL] and the standard deviation approximated by $\sigma$ = `sem` = `jl round(getSem(beerVolumes), digits=2)` [mL]).

In conclusion, our hunch was right ("...you got an impression that the producer is not being honest with their customers..."). The owner of the local brewery is dishonest and intentionally pours slightly less beer (on average `expectedBeerVolmL - meanBeerVol` = `jl round(expectedBeerVolmL - meanBeerVol, digits=0)` [mL]). Now we can go to him and get our money back, or alarm the proper authorities for that monstrous crime. *Fun fact: the story has it that the [code of Hammurabi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_Hammurabi) (circa 1750 BC) was the first to punish for diluting a beer with water (although it seems to be more of a legend).* Still, this is like 2-3% beer (â‰ˆ13/500 = 0.026) in a bottle less than it should be and the two-tailed probability (`fractionBeerAbove500mL * 2` = `jl round(fractionBeerAbove500mL * 2, digits=3)`) is not much less than the cutoff for type 1 error equal to 0.05 (we may want to collect a bigger sample and change the cutoff to 0.01).

### HypothesisTests package {#sec:compare_contin_data_hypo_tests_package}

The above paragraphs were to further your understanding of the topic. In practice you can do this much faster using [HypothesisTests](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/) package.

In our beer example you could go with this short snippet (see [the docs](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/parametric/#t-test) for `Htests.OneSampleTTest`)

```jl
s = """
import HypothesisTests as Htests

Htests.OneSampleTTest(beerVolumes, expectedBeerVolmL)
"""
sco(s)
```

Let's compare it with our previous results

```jl
s = """
(
expectedBeerVolmL, # value under h_0
meanBeerVol, # point estimate
fractionBeerAbove500mL * 2, # two-sided p-value
getZScore(meanBeerVol, getSem(beerVolumes), expectedBeerVolmL), # t-statistic
getDf(beerVolumes), # degrees of freedom
getSem(beerVolumes) # empirical standard error
)
"""
sco(s)
```

The numbers are pretty much the same (and they should be if the previous explanation was right). The t-statistic is positive in our case because `getZScore` subtracts `mean` from `value` (`value - mean`) and some packages (like `HypothesisTests`) swap the numbers.

The value that needs to be additionally explained is the [95% confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) from the output of `HypothesisTests` above. All it means is that: if we were to run our experiment with 10 beers 100 times and calculate 95% confidence intervals 100 times then 95 of the intervals would contained the true mean from the population. Sometimes people simplify it and say that this interval [in our case (473.8, 499.6)] contains the true mean from the population with probability of 95% (but that isn't necessarily the same what was stated in the previous sentence). The narrower interval means better, more precise estimate. If the difference is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) then the interval should not contain the postulated mean (as in our case).

In general one sample t-test is used to check if a sample comes from a population with the postulated mean (in our case the postulated mean was 500 [mL]). However, I prefer to look at it from the different perspective (the other end) hence my explanation above. The t-test is named after [William Sealy Gosset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset) that published his papers under the pen-name Student, hence it is also called a Student's t-test.

### Checking the assumptions {#sec:compare_contin_data_check_assump}

Hopefully, the explanations above were clear enough. Still, we shouldn't just jump into performing a test blindly, first we should test its assumptions (see figure below).

![Checking assumptions of a statistical test before running it.](./images/testAssumptionsCheckCycle.png){#fig:testAssumptionsCheckCycle}

First of all we start by choosing a test to perform. Then we check our assumptions. If they hold we proceed with our test. Otherwise we can either transform the data (e.g. take a logarithm from each value) or choose a different test (the one that got different assumptions or just less of them to fulfill).

In our case a Student's t-test requires data to be normally distributed. This is usually verified with [Shapiro-Wilk test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test) or [Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test). As an alternative to Student's t-test (when the normality assumption does not hold) a [Wilcoxon test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilcoxon_signed-rank_test) is often performed (of course before you use it you should check its assumptions, see @fig:testAssumptionsCheckCycle above).

Both Kolmogorov-Smirnov (see [this docs](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test)) and Wilcoxon test (see [that docs](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Wilcoxon-signed-rank-test)) are at our disposal in `HypothesisTests` package. Behold

```jl
s = """
Htests.ExactOneSampleKSTest(beerVolumes,
	Dsts.Normal(meanBeerVol, stdBeerVol))
"""
sco(s)
```

So it seems we got no grounds to reject the $H_{0}$ that states that our data are normally distributed (p-value > 0.05) and we were right to perform our one-sample Student's t-test. Of course, I had checked the assumptions before I conducted the test. I didn't mention it there because I didn't want to prolong and interrupt my explanation back there.

And now a question. Is the boring assumption check before a statistical test really necessary?

Only if you want your conclusions to reflect the reality well.

So, yes. Even though a statistical textbook for brevity may not check the assumptions of a method you should always do it in your analyses if your care about the correctness of your judgment.

---

**Flashback**

Notice that `HypothesisTests` contains a lot of useful tests (some of them we will discuss shortly). For instance in Exercise 3 (see @sec:statistics_intro_exercise3 and @sec:statistics_intro_exercise3_solution) we calculated the probability that Peter is a better tennis player than John if he won 5 games out of 6. The two-tailed probability was equal to `Dsts.pdf.(Dsts.Binomial(6, 0.5), 5:6) |> sum |> x -> x * 2` = `jl Dsts.pdf.(Dsts.Binomial(6, 0.5), 5:6) |> sum |> x -> round(x * 2, digits=4)`. Once we know the logic behind the calculations (see @sec:statistics_intro_exercise3_solution) we can fast forward to the solution with [Htests.BinomialTest](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Binomial-test) like so

```jl
s = """
Htests.BinomialTest(5, 6, 0.5)
# or just: Htests.BinomialTest(5, 6) # (since 0.5 is the default value)
"""
sco(s)
```

Works like a charm. Don't you think. Here the 95% confidence interval is an estimate of the true probability of Peter's victory in a game (from data it is 5/6 = `jl round(5/6, digits=2)`). I leave the rest of the output to decipher to you.

To be continued...
