# About {#sec:about}

Hi, I'm Bart and this is my first 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is Basic Statistics"

In this book I will explore some basic statistics (the way I see it) with
[Julia](https://julialang.org/). Actually, I wrote the book for myself from the
past. Too bad the past me won't be able to read it. Nevertheless, I hope it is
gonna be of some value to someone that resembles me from the old
days. Additionally, I wrote it to solidify my own knowledge of statistics and
Julia, after all they say we best teach that of what we learn :) Still, the book
may contain some errors so don't believe everything you read here.

Who am I (not)? I'm not a statistician, a mathematician, or a computer
scientist, but a biologist by education. Nowadays, I'm a programming
enthusiast. To be honest, statistics was not my favorite subject when I was at
college. I didn't quite get it then, I got it somewhat better now. Hopefully
this will make the book easier to digest, although possibly somewhat biased
towards biology.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I'm not an English native speaker (keep that in mind
while reading this book). Still, despite all the book's (and mine) flaws, I hope
it will be useful to someone (it is available under [Creative Commons
