# About {#sec:about}

This is my first 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is Basic Statistics"

In this book I will explore some basic statistics (the way I see it) with [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Actually, I wrote it for myself from the past. Too bad the past me won't be able to read it, still I hope it is gonna be of some value to someone that resembles me from the old days. Additionally, I wrote this book to solidify my own knowledge of statistics and Julia :)

Who am I (not)? I'm not a statistician, mathematician, or a computer scientist, but a biologist by education. Nowadays, I'm an enthusiast programmer. To be honest, statistics was not my favorite subject when I was at college. I didn't get it then, I got it somewhat better now. Hopefully this will make the book easier to digest, although possibly more biased towards biology.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I'm not an English native speaker (keep that in mind while reading this book). Still, I hope the book will be useful to someone (it is available under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license).
