# About {#sec:about}

My first 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is Basic Statistics"

In this book I will explore some basic statistics (the way I see it) with [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

I'm not a statistician, mathematician, or a computer scientist, but a biologist by education. Nowadays, I'm an enthusiast programmer. To be honest, statistics was not my favorite subject when I was at college. I didn't get it then, I got it somewhat better now. Hopefully this will make the book easier to digest, although possibly more biased towards biology.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, I'm not an English native speaker (keep that in mind while reading this book). Still, I hope the book will be useful to someone (it is available under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license).
