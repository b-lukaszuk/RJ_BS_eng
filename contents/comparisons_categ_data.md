# Comparisons - categorical data {#sec:compare_categ_data}

OK, once we have comparisons of continuous data under our belts we can move to
groups of categorical data.

## Chapter imports {#sec:compare_categ_data_imports}

Later in this chapter we are going to use the following libraries

```jl
s6 = """
import CairoMakie as Cmk
import DataFrames as Dfs
import Distributions as Dsts
import HypothesisTests as Htests
import MultipleTesting as Mt
import Random as Rand
"""
sc(s6)
```

If you want to follow along you should have them installed on your system. A
reminder of how to deal (install and such) with packages can be found
[here](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/). But wait, you may prefer
to use `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files from the [code snippets for this
chapter](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/RJ_BS_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/ch06)
to install the required packages. The instructions you will find
[here](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/environments/).

The imports will be placed in the code snippet when first used, but I thought it
is a good idea to put them here, after all imports should be at the top of your
file (so here they are at the top of the chapter). Moreover, that way they will
be easier to find all in one place.

If during the lecture of this chapter you find a piece of code of unknown
functionality, just go to the code snippets mentioned above and run the code
from the `*.jl` file. Once you have done that you can always extract a small
piece of it and test it separately (modify and experiment with it if you
wish).

## Flashback {#sec:compare_categ_data_flashback}

We deal with categorical data when a variable can take a value from a small set
of values. Each element of the set is clearly distinct from the other
elements. For instance the results of coin tosses or dice rolls fall into one of
a few distinctive categories. As stated in @sec:statistics_intro and its
subsections the result of a coin toss often displays the binomial
distribution. In line with that notion, in Exercise 3 (see
@sec:statistics_intro_exercise3 and @sec:statistics_intro_exercise3_solution) we
calculated the probability that Peter is a better tennis player than John if he
won 5 games out of 6. The two-tailed probability was roughly equal to
 `jl round(probBothOneTail * 2, digits=2)`. Once we know the logic behind the
calculations (see @sec:statistics_intro_exercise3_solution) we can fast forward
to the solution with
[Htests.BinomialTest](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Binomial-test)
like so

```jl
s = """
import HypothesisTests as Htests

Htests.BinomialTest(5, 6, 0.5)
# or just: Htests.BinomialTest(5, 6)
# since 0.5 is the default prob. for the population
"""
sco(s)
```

Works like a charm. Don't you think. Here we got a two-tailed p-value.
By oversimplifying stuff we can say that the 95% confidence interval is an
estimate of the true probability of Peter's victory in a game
(from data it is 5/6 = `jl round(5/6, digits=2)`) and it includes 0.5 (our
probability under $H_{0}$ = 0.5). I leave the rest of the output to decipher to
you (as a mini-exercise).

In general `Htests.BinomialTest` is useful when you want to compare the obtained
experimental result that may fall into one of two categories (generally
called: success or failure) with a theoretical binomial distribution with a
known probability of success (we check if the obtained result is compatible with
that distribution). If we interpret this statement in a more creative way we may
find other use cases for the test.

Let's look at an interesting example from the field of biological
sciences. Imagine that there is some disease that you want to study. Its
prevalence in the general population is estimated to be â‰ˆ $\frac{10}{100}$ = 0.1
= 10% . You happened to found a human population on a desert island and noticed
that 519 adults out of 3'202 suffer from the disease of interest. You run the
test to see if that differs from the general population [here success (if I may
call it so) is the presence of the disease, and theoretical distribution is the
distribution of the disease in the general population].

```jl
s = """
Htests.BinomialTest(519, 3202, 0.1)
"""
sco(s)
```

And it turns out that it does. Congratulations, you discovered a local
population with a different, clearly higher prevalence of the disease. Now you
(or other people) can study the population closer (e.g. gene screening) in order
to find the features that trigger the onset of (or predispose to develop) the
disease.

The story is not that far fetched since there are human populations that are of
particular interest to scientists due to their unusually common occurrence of
some diseases (e.g. [the Akimel
O'odham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akimel_O%27odham) and their high
prevalence of [type 2 diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes)).

## Chi squared test {#sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test}

We finished the previous section by comparing the proportion of subjects with
some feature to the reference population. For that we used
`Htests.BinomialTest`. As we learned in @sec:statistics_normal_distribution the
word binomial means two names. Those names could be anything, like heads and
tails, victory and defeat, but most generally they are called success and
failure (success when an event occurred and failure when it did not). We can
use `a` to denote individuals with the feature of interest and `b` to denote the
individuals without that feature. In that case `n` is the total number of
individuals (here, individuals with either `a` or `b`). That means that by doing
`Htests.BinomialTest` we compared the sample fraction (e.g. $\frac{a}{n}$ or
equivalently $\frac{a}{a+b}$) with the assumed fraction of individuals with the
feature of interest in the general population.

Now, imagine a different situation. You take the samples from two populations,
and observe the [eye color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color) of
people. You want to know if the percentage of people with blue eyes in the two
populations is similar. If it is, then you may deduce they are closely related
(perhaps one stems from the other). Let's not look too far, let's just take the
population of the US and UK. Inspired by the Wikipedia's page from the link
above and supported by the random number generator in Julia I came up with the
following counts.

```jl
s = """
import DataFrames as Dfs

dfEyeColor = Dfs.DataFrame(
	Dict(
		"eyeCol" => ["blue", "any"],
		"us" => [161, 481],
		"uk" => [220, 499]
	)
)
Options(dfEyeColor, caption="Eye color distribution in two samples (fictitious data).", label="dfEyeColor")
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("Options.*") => "")
```

Here, we would like to compare if the two proportions ($\frac{a_1}{n_1} =
\frac{161}{481}$ and $\frac{a_2}{n_2} = \frac{220}{499}$) are roughly equal
($H_0$: they come from the same population with some fraction of blue eyed
people). Unfortunately, one look into [the
docs](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Binomial-test)
and we see that we cannot use `Htests.BinomialTest` (the test compares sample
with a population, here we got two samples to compare). But do not despair
that's the job for
[Htests.ChisqTest](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/parametric/#Pearson-chi-squared-test)
(see also [this Wikipedia's
entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test)). First we need to
change our data slightly, because the test requires a matrix (aka array from
@sec:julia_arrays) with the following proportions in columns: $\frac{a_1}{b_1}$
and $\frac{a_2}{b_2}$ (`b` instead of `n`, where `n` = `a` + `b`). Let's adjust
our data for that.

```jl
s1 = """
# subtracting eye color "blue" from eye color "any"
dfEyeColor[2, 2:3] = Vector(dfEyeColor[2, 2:3]) .-
	Vector(dfEyeColor[1, 2:3])
# renaming eye color "any" to "other" (it better reflects current content)
dfEyeColor[2, 1] = "other"
dfEyeColor

# all the elements must be of the same (numeric) type
mEyeColor = Matrix{Int}(dfEyeColor[:, 2:3])
mEyeColor
"""
sco(s1)
```

OK, we got the necessary data structure. Here, `Matrix{Int}()` closed over
`dfEyeColor[:, 2:3]` extracts the needed part of the data frame and converts it
to a matrix (aka array) of integers. And now for the $\chi^2$ (chi squared)
test.

```jl
s = """
Htests.ChisqTest(mEyeColor)
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("interval:") => "interval:\n\t")
```

OK, first of all we can see right away that the p-value is below the customary
cutoff level of 0.05 or even 0.01. This means that the samples do not come from
the same population (we reject $H_{0}$). More likely they came from the
populations with different underlying proportions of blue eyed people. This
could indicate for instance, that the population of the US stemmed from the UK
(at least partially) but it has a greater admixture of other cultures, which
could potentially influence the distribution of blue eyed people. Still, this is
just an exemplary explanation, I'm not an anthropologist, so it may well be
incorrect. Additionally, remember that the data is fictitious and was generated
by me.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure You got the part with the p-value on your own, but what
are some of the other outputs. Point estimates are the observed probabilities in
each of the cells from `mEyeColor`. Observe

```jl
s = """
# total number of observations
nObsEyeColor = sum(mEyeColor)

chi2pointEstimates = [mEyeColor...] ./ nObsEyeColor
round.(chi2pointEstimates, digits = 6)
"""
sco(s)
```

The `[mEyeColor...]` flattens the 2x2 matrix (2 rows, 2 columns) to a vector
(column 2 is appended to the end of column 1). The `./ nObsEyeColor` divides the
observations in each cell by the total number of observations.

`95% confidence interval` is a 95% confidence interval (who would have guessed)
similar to the one explained in @sec:compare_contin_data_hypo_tests_package for
`Htests.OneSampleTTest` but for each of the point estimates in
`chi2pointEstimates`. Some (over)simplify it and say that within those limits
the true probability for this group of observations most likely lies.

As for the `value under h_0` those are the probabilities of the observations
being in a given cell of `mEyeColor` assuming $H_0$ is true. But how to get that
probabilities. Well, in a similar way to the method we met in
@sec:statistics_intro_probability_properties. Back then we answered the
following question: If parents got blood groups AB and O then what is the
probability that a child will produce a gamete with allele `A`? The answer:
proportion of children with allele `A` and then the proportion of their gametes
with allele `A` (see @sec:statistics_intro_probability_properties for
details). We calculated it using the following formula

$P(A\ in\ CG) = P(A\ in\ C) * P(A\ in\ gametes\ of\ C\ with\ A)$

Getting back to our `mEyeColor` the expected probability of an observation
falling into a given cell of the matrix is the probability of an observation
falling into a given column times the probability of an observation falling into
a given row. Observe

```jl
s = """
# cProbs - probability of a value to be found in a given column
cProbs = [sum(c) for c in eachcol(mEyeColor)] ./ nObsEyeColor
# rProbs - probability of a value to be found in a given row
rProbs = [sum(r) for r in eachrow(mEyeColor)] ./ nObsEyeColor

# probability of a value to be found in a given cell of mEyeColor
# under H_0 (the samples are from the same population)
probsUnderH0 = [cp * rp for cp in cProbs for rp in rProbs]
round.(probsUnderH0, digits = 6)
"""
sco(s)
```

Here, `[cp * rp for cp in cProbs for rp in rProbs]` is an example of [nested
for
loops](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Controlling_the_flow#Nested_loops)
enclosed in a comprehension. Notice that in the case of this comprehension there
is no comma before the second `for` (the comma is present in the long,
non-comprehension version of nested for loops in the link above).

Anyway, note that since the calculations from
@sec:statistics_intro_probability_properties assumed the probability
independence, then the same assumption is made here. That means that, e.g. a
given person cannot be classified at the same time as the citizen of the US and
UK since we would have openly violated the assumption (some countries allow
double citizenship, so you should think carefully about the inclusion criteria
for the categories). Moreover, the eye color also needs to be a clear cut.

Out of the remaining output we are mostly interested in the `statistic`, namely
$\chi^2$ (chi square) statistic. Under the null hypothesis ($H_{0}$, both groups
come from the same population with a given fraction of blue eyed individuals)
the probability distribution for counts to occur is called $\chi^2$ (chi
squared) distribution. Next, we calculate $\chi^2$ (chi squared) statistic for
the observed result (from `mEyeColor`). Then, we obtain the probability of a
statistic greater than that to occur by chance. This is similar to the
F-Statistic (@sec:compare_contin_data_one_way_anova) and L-Statistic
(@sec:compare_contin_data_ex2_solution) we met before. Let's see this in
practice

```jl
s = """
observedCounts = [mEyeColor...]
expectedCounts = probsUnderH0 .* nObsEyeColor
# the statisticians love squaring numbers, don't they
chi2Diffs = ((observedCounts .- expectedCounts) .^2) ./ expectedCounts
chi2Statistic = sum(chi2Diffs)

(
	observedCounts,
	round.(expectedCounts, digits = 4),
	round.(chi2Diffs, digits = 4),
	round(chi2Statistic, digits = 4)
)
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("], ") => "],\n")
```

The code is rather self explanatory. BTW. You might have noticed that: a)
statisticians love squaring numbers (differences), and b) there are some
similarities to the calculations of expected values from
@sec:statistics_prob_distribution. Anyway, now, we can use the $\chi^2$
statistic to get the p-value, like so

```jl
s = """
import Distributions as Dsts

function getDf(matrix::Matrix{Int})::Int
	nRows, nCols = size(matrix)
	return (nRows - 1) * (nCols - 1)
end

# p-value
# alternative: Dsts.ccdf(Dsts.Chisq(getDf(mEyeColor)), chi2Statistic)
1 - Dsts.cdf(Dsts.Chisq(getDf(mEyeColor)), chi2Statistic) |>
	x -> round(x, digits = 4)
"""
sco(s)
```

So, the pattern is quite similar to what we did in the case of
F-Distribution/Statistic in @sec:compare_contin_data_ex2. First we created the
distribution of interest with the appropriate number of the degrees of freedom
(why only the degrees of freedom matter see the conclusion of
@sec:compare_contin_data_ex2_solution). Then we calculated the probability of a
$\chi^2$ Statistic being greater than the observed one by chance alone and
that's it.

## Fisher's exact test {#sec:compare_categ_data_fisher_exact_text}

This was all nice, but there is a small problem with the $\chi^2$ test, namely
it relies on some approximations and works well only for large sample sizes. How
large, well, I've heard about the rule of fives (that's what I called it). The
rule states that there should be >= 50 (not quite 5) observations per matrix and
>= 5 expected observations per cell (applies to every cell). In case this
assumption does not hold, one should use, e.g. [Fisher's exact
test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) (Fisher, yes, I think
I heard that name before).

So let's assume for a moment that we were able to collect somewhat less data
like in the matrix below:

```jl
s = """
mEyeColorSmall = round.(Int, mEyeColor ./ 20)
mEyeColorSmall
"""
sco(s)
```

Here, we reduced the number of observations 20 times compared to the original
`mEyeColor` matrix from the previous section. Since the test we are going to
apply
([Htests.FisherExactTest](https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/nonparametric/#Fisher-exact-test))
requires integers then instead of rounding a number to 0 digits
[e.g. `round(12.3, digits = 0)` would return 12.0, so `Float64`] we asked the
round function to deliver us the closest integers (e.g. 12).

OK, let's, run the said `Htests.FisherExactTest`. Right away we see a
problem, the test requires separate integers as input:
`Htests.FisherExactTest(a::Integer, b::Integer, c::Integer, d::Integer)`.

> **_Note:_** Just like `Real` type from @sec:julia_language_functions also
> `Integer` is a supertype. It encompasses, e.g. `Int` and `BigInt` we met
> in @sec:julia_language_exercise5_solution.

Still, we can obtain the necessary results very simply, by:

```jl
s = """
# assignment goes column by column (left to right), value by value
a, c, b, d = mEyeColorSmall

Htests.FisherExactTest(a, b, c, d)
"""
sco(s)
```

We are not going to discuss the output in detail. Still, we can see that here
due to the small sample size we don't have enough evidence to reject the $H_{0}$
(p > 0.05) on favor of $H_{A}$. Interestingly, due to the small sample size we
came to a different conclusion despite the same underlying populations and the
same proportions. Let's make an analogy here and let's take it to an extreme.
Imagine I got two coins in my pocket, one fair (50/50 heads to tails rate) and
one biased (70/30 heads to tails ratio). I give you one to find out which coin
it is. That's easy to settle out with 1'000 tosses (since you wold get, e.g.
688/312 heads to tails ratio instead of 494/506), but it is not possible to do
it with just one toss (no matter the outcome). With three tosses and two heads
we still cannot be sure of it since a fair coin would have produced this exact
output with the probability of 37.5% (`HHT`, or `THH`, or `HTH` each with p =
$\frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125$) and more extreme (`HHH`) with the
probability = 12.5% ($\frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{8}$ = 0.125). So, there just
wouldn't be enough evidence.

## Bigger table {#sec:compare_categ_data_bigger_table}

We started @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test with a fictitious eye color
distribution [`blue` and `other`, rows (top-down) in the matrix below] in the US
and UK [columns (left-right) in the matrix below].

```jl
s = """
mEyeColor
"""
sco(s)
```

But in reality there are more eye colors than just blue and other. For instance
let's say that in humans we got three types of eye color: blue, green, and
brown. Let's adjust our table for that:

```jl
s = """
# 3 x 2 table (DataFrame)
dfEyeColorFull = Dfs.DataFrame(
	Dict(
		# "other" from dfEyeColor is split into "green" and "brown"
		"eyeCol" => ["blue", "green", "brown"],
		"us" => [161, 78, 242],
		"uk" => [220, 149, 130]
	)
)

mEyeColorFull = Matrix{Int}(dfEyeColorFull[:, 2:3])
mEyeColorFull
"""
sco(s)
```

Can we say that the two populations differ (with respect to the eye color
distribution) given the data in this table? Well, we can, that's the job for ...
chi squared ($\chi^2$) test.

Wait, but I thought it is used to compare two proportions found in some
samples. Granted, it could be used for that, but in broader sense it is a
non-parametric test that determines the probability that the difference between
the observed and expected frequencies (counts) occurred by chance alone. Here,
non-parametric means it does not assume a specific underlying distribution of
data (like the normal or binomial distribution we met before). As we learned in
@sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test the expected distribution of frequencies
(counts) is assessed based on the data itself.

Let's give it a try with our new data set (`mEyeColorFull`) and compare it with
the previously obtained results (for `mEyeColor` from
@sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test).

```jl
s = """
chi2testEyeColor = Htests.ChisqTest(mEyeColor)
chi2testEyeColorFull = Htests.ChisqTest(mEyeColorFull)

(
	# chi^2 statistics
	round(chi2testEyeColorFull.stat, digits = 2),
	round(chi2testEyeColor.stat, digits = 2),

	# p-values
	round(chi2testEyeColorFull |> Htests.pvalue, digits = 7),
	round(chi2testEyeColor |> Htests.pvalue, digits = 7)
)
"""
replace(sco(s), "62, " => "62,\n")
```

That's odd. All we did was to split the `other` category from `dfEyeColor` (and
therefore `mEyeColor`) into `green` and `brown` to create `dfEyeColorFull` (and
therefore `mEyeColorFull`) and yet we got different $\chi^2$ statistics, and
different p-values. How come?

Well, because we are comparing different things (and different populations).

Imagine that in the case of `dfEyeColor` (and `mEyeColor`) we actually compare
not the eye color, but currency of both countries. So, we change the labels in
our table. Instead of `blue` we got `heads` and instead of `other` we got
`tails` and instead of `us` we got
[eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(United_States_coin)) and instead of
`uk` we got [one pound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_pound_(British_coin)).
We want to test if the proportion of heads/tails is roughly the same for both
the coins.

Whereas in the case of `dfEyeColorFull` (and `mEyeColorFull`) imagine we
actually compare not the eye color, but [three sided
dice](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=571684704&q=three+sided+dice&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1k-bB-uWBAxUa3AIHHWDvDoIQ0pQJegQIDBAB&biw=1437&bih=696&dpr=1.33)
produced in those countries. So, we change the labels in our table. Instead of
`blue` we got `1` and instead of `green` we got `2`, instead of `brown` we got
`3` (`1`, `2`, `3` is a convention, equally well one could write on the sides of
a dice, e.g. `Tom`, `Alice`, and `John`). We want to test if the distribution of
`1`s, `2`s, and `3`s is roughly the same for both types of dice.

Now, it so happened that the number of dice throws was the same that the number
of coin tosses from the example above. It also happened that the number of `1`s
was the same as the number of `head`s from the previous example. Still, we are
comparing different things (coins and dices) and so we would not expect to get
the same results from our chi squared ($\chi^2$) test. And that is how it is,
the test is label blind. All it cares is the difference between the
observed and expected frequencies (counts).

Anyway, the value of $\chi^2$ statistic for `mEyeColorFull` is
 `jl round(chi2testEyeColorFull.stat, digits = 2)`
and the probability that such a value occurred by chance approximates 0.
Therefore, it is below our customary cutoff level of 0.05, and we may conclude
that the populations differ with respect to the distribution of eye color (as we
did in @sec:compare_categ_data_bigger_table).

Now, let's get back for a moment to the label blindness issue. The test may be
label blind, but we are not. It is possible that sooner or later you will come
across a data set where splitting groups into different categories will lead you
to different conclusions, e.g. p-value from $\chi^2$ test for `mEyeColorPlSp`
for Poland and Spain would be 0.054, and for `mEyeColorPlSpFull` it would be
0.042 (so it is and it isn't statistically different at the same time). What
should you do then?

Well, it happens. There is not much to be done here. We need to live with
that. It is like the accused and judge analogy from
@sec:statistics_intro_errors. In reality the accused is guilty or not. We don't
know the truth, the best we can do is to examine the evidence. After that one
judge may incline to declare the accused guilty the other will give him the
benefit of doubt. There is no certainty or a great solution here (at least I
don't know it). In such a case some people suggest to present both the results
with the author's conclusions and let the readers decide for themselves. Others
suggest to collect a greater sample to make sure which conclusion is
right. Still, others suggest that you should plan your experiment (its goals and
the ways to achieve them) carefully beforehand. Once you got your data you stick
to the plan even if the result is disappointing to you. So, if we had decided to
compare `blue` vs `other` and failed to establish the statistical significance
we ought stopped there. We should not go fishing for statistical significance by
splitting `other` to `green` and `brown`.

## Test for independence {#sec:compare_categ_test_for_independence}

Another way to look at the chi squared ($\chi^2$) test is that this is a test
that allows to check the independence of the distribution of the data between
the rows and columns (see the assumption we made when calculating the expected
counts with `probsUnderH0` in @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test). Let's make
this more concrete with the following example.

Previously we concerned ourselves with the `mEyeColorFull` table.

```jl
s = """
mEyeColorFull
"""
sco(s)
```

The rows contain (top to bottom) eye colors: `blue`, `green`, and `brown`. The
columns (left to right) are for `us` and `uk`.

Interestingly enough, the eye color depends on the concentration of
[melanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin), a pigment that is also present
in skin and hair and protects us from the harmful UV radiation. So imagine that
the columns contain the data for some skin condition (left column: `diseaseX`,
right column: `noDiseaseX`). Now, we are interested to know, if people with a
certain eye color are more exposed (more vulnerable) to the disease (if so then
some preventive measures, e.g. a stronger sun screen, could be applied by them).

Since this is a fictitious data set on which we only changed the column labels
then we already know the answer (see the reminder from
@sec:compare_categ_data_bigger_table below)

```jl
s = """
(
	round(chi2testEyeColorFull.stat, digits = 2),
	round(chi2testEyeColorFull |> Htests.pvalue, digits = 7)
)
"""
sco(s)
```

OK, so based on the (fictitious) data there is enough evidence to consider that
the occurrence of `diseaseX` isn't independent from eye color ($p \le 0.05$). In
other words, people of some eye color get `diseaseX` more often than people
with some other eye color. But which eye color (`blue`, `green`, `brown`)
carries the greater risk? Pause for a moment and think how to answer the
question.

Well, one thing we could do is to collapse some rows (if it makes sense), for
instance we could collapse `green` and `brown` into `other` category (we would
end up with two eye colors: `blue` and `other`). So in practice we would answer
the same question that we did in @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test for
`mEyeColor` (of course here we changed column labels to `diseaseX` and
`noDiseaseX`).

```jl
s = """
rowPerc = [r[1] / sum(r) * 100 for r in eachrow(mEyeColor)]
rowPerc = round.(rowPerc, digits = 2)

(
	round(chi2testEyeColor.stat, digits = 2),
	round(chi2testEyeColor |> Htests.pvalue, digits = 7),
	rowPerc
)
"""
sco(s)
```

We see that roughly `jl rowPerc[1]`% of `blue` eyed people got `diseaseX`
compared to roughly `jl rowPerc[2]`% of people with `other` eye color and that
the difference is statistically significant ($p \le 0.05$). So people with
`other` eye color should be more careful with exposure to sun (of course, these
are just made up data).

Another option is to use a method analogous to the one we applied in
@sec:compare_contin_data_one_way_anova and
@sec:compare_contin_data_post_hoc_tests. Back then we compared three groups of
continuous variables with one-way ANOVA [it controls for the overall $\alpha$
(type 1 error)]. Then we used a post-hoc tests (Student's t-tests) to figure out
which group(s) differ(s) from the other(s). Naturally, we could/should adjust
the obtained p-values by using a multiplicity correction (as we did in
@sec:compare_contin_data_multip_correction). This is exactly what we are going
to do in the upcoming exercises (see @sec:compare_categ_data_ex5 and
@sec:compare_categ_data_ex6). For now take some rest and click the right arrow
when you're ready.

## Exercises - Comparisons of Categorical Data {#sec:compare_categ_data_exercises}

Just like in the previous chapters here you will find some exercises that you
may want to solve to get from this chapter as much as you can (best
option). Alternatively, you may read the task descriptions and the solutions
(and try to understand them).

### Exercise 1 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex1}

In @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test and @sec:compare_categ_data_bigger_table
we dealt with `dfEyeColor` and `dfEyeColorFull`, i.e. the data sets that were
already in the form of a contingency table. Usually, this is not the case.

Imagine that you are a researcher and you want to find out if certain
professions are associated with a greater risk of smoking cigarettes (perhaps as
a way to alleviate the stress). So you prepare a questionnaire. People answer
two questions: "Q1. What is your profession?" and "Q2. Do you smoke?". The
answers to Q1 are placed in one column of a spreadsheet, the answers to
Q2 are placed into another column. An exemplary data could look this way:

```jl
s = """
import Random as Rand

Rand.seed!(321)
smoker = Rand.rand(["no", "yes"], 100)
profession = Rand.rand(["Lawyer", "Priest", "Teacher"], 100)
"""
sc(s)
```

Write a function with the following signature

```
function getContingencyTable(
    rowVect::Vector{String},
    colVect::Vector{String},
    )::Matrix{Int}
```

The function should take two arguments (observations as vectors of strings) and
return a contingency table (`Matrix{Int}`) with the counts (similar to
`mEyeColor` or `mEyeColorFull`). You may modify the function slightly, e.g to
return `Dfs.DataFrame` similar to the one produced by
[FreqTables.freqtable](https://github.com/nalimilan/FreqTables.jl) (it doesn't
have to be exact).

Test your function with the data presented above. Make sure it works properly
also for smaller data sets, i.e.

```jl
s = """
Rand.seed!(321)
smokerSmall = Rand.rand(["no", "yes"], 10)
professionSmall = Rand.rand(["Lawyer", "Priest", "Teacher"], 10)
"""
sc(s)
```

Here, the contingency table should contain zeros in some cells.

Below you may find a list of functions that I found useful (you may check them
in [the docs](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/)). Of course you don't have to
use any of them. The functions are sorted alphabetically.

- `Dfs.insertcols!` ([DataFrames docs](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/))
- `collect`
- `getCounts` (from @sec:statistics_prob_theor_practice)
- `sort`
- `unique`
- `zip`

### Exercise 2 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex2}

In @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test we concluded that the populations of the
`us` and `uk` differ with respect to eye color distribution (we used data from
`mEyeColor`).

Still, it's often nice to know not just the numbers themselves, but the
proportions (or percentage distribution of the data in a table).

So, here is a task for you. Write the following functions

```
function getColPerc(m::Matrix{Int})::Matrix{Float64}

# and

function getRowPerc(m::Matrix{Int})::Matrix{Float64}
```

that should work similarly to
[FreqTables.prop](https://github.com/nalimilan/FreqTables.jl) (`prop(tbl2,
margins=2)`, and `prop(tbl2, margins=1)`), i.e they should return the column and
row percentage of observations, respectively.

To reduce code duplication you may
want to combine them into a single function, e.g. `getPerc(m::Matrix{Int},
byRow::Bool)::Matrix{Float64}` that returns row percentages when `byRow` is
true, and column percentages otherwise. You my also want to round the numbers
(percents) to e.g. 2 decimal points.

In my solution I used [nested for
loops](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Controlling_the_flow#Nested_loops),
but feel free to write it whatever way you like (as long as it works fine).

### Exercise 3 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex3}

The functions we developed previously (see @sec:compare_categ_data_ex2_solution)
are nice and useful. Still, we might want to have a visual aid to help us with
the interpretation of our data.

So here is another task for you. Using CairoMakie or your favorite plotting
library write a function that accepts a data frame like `dfEyeColorFull` and
draws a stacked bar plot depicting column percentages (search the documentation
for [barplot](https://docs.makie.org/stable/reference/plots/barplot/)).

You may use the functions we developed before.

If you want, you can make your function also draw row percentages (optional).

### Exercise 4 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex4}

This exercise is pretty easy and straightforward. In
@sec:compare_categ_data_fisher_exact_text we said that the chi squared
($\chi^2$) test requires the table to fulfill a few assumptions, e.g.:

- total number of observations to be >= 50
- the expected number of observations per a cell to be >= 5

So here is the task. Write a function with the following signature

```
runCategTestGetPVal(m::Matrix{Int})::Float64
# or
runCategTestGetPVal(df::Dfs.DataFrame)::Float64
```

The function takes a 2x2 matrix (like `mEyeColor` or `mEyeColorSmall`) or a data
frame (like `dfEyeColor`). Then the function tests the above mentioned
assumptions and runs `Htests.ChisqTest` or `Htests.FisherExactTest` on its input
and returns the obtained p-value. Feel free to use the functionalities we
developed in this chapter (@sec:compare_categ_data) and its sub-chapters.

### Exercise 5 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex5}

In @sec:compare_categ_test_for_independence we analyzed the data in
`dfEyeColorFull` (alternatively `mEyeColorFull`) and concluded that the
distribution of eye color between the two tested countries differed. Still, we
were unable to tell which (two eye colors) distributions differ from each other.

So here is the task. Write a function that accepts a matrix (or a data frame if
you will) like `mEyeColor`/`dfEyeColorFull` (where the number of rows and/or
columns with counts is greater than 2). The function should return a vector of
all possible 2x2 matrices/data frames (I found `getUniquePairs` from
@sec:compare_contin_data_ex4_solution to be useful here, but you may use
whatever you want).

Once you got the data structure with the data frames write another function that
runs the appropriate test (`runCategTestGetPVal` from
@sec:compare_categ_data_ex4 above) on each of the matrices/data frames from the
previous paragraph and return the p-values (choose the appropriate data
structure).

In the last step write a function that applies a multiplicity correction (see
@sec:compare_contin_data_multip_correction) to the obtained p-values.

### Exercise 6 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex6}

Too cool down let's end this chapter with something easy but potentially useful.

As you have learned by now in programming we often end up using our old
functions (or at least I do), although we tend to tweak them a little to adjust
them to the ever changing needs.

In this task I want you to change the `drawColPerc` from
@sec:compare_categ_data_ex3_solution (or your own solution to
@sec:compare_categ_data_ex3). You can name the new function, e.g. `drawColPerc2`
(wow, how original). The new function should accept among others a bigger data
frame (like `dfEyeColorFull`). Inside it runs `runCategTestsGetPVals` we
developed in @sec:compare_categ_data_ex5_solution (with multiplicity
correction). Then it should draw the stacked barplots (it draws one stacked
barplot for each data frame, the drawings should be set in one column, but in
multiple rows, so a graph under a graph). If the distribution in a data frame is
statistically significant add a stroke (`strokewidth` argument) to the barplot.

## Solutions - Comparisons of Categorical Data {#sec:compare_categ_data_exercises_solutions}

In this sub-chapter you will find exemplary solutions to the exercises from the
previous section.

### Solution to Exercise 1 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex1_solution}

An exemplary `getContingencyTable` could look like this (here, a version that
produces output that resembles the result of `FreqTables.freqtable`):

```jl
s = """
function getContingencyTable(
    rowVect::Vector{String},
    colVect::Vector{String},
    rowLabel::String,
    colLabel::String,
    )::Dfs.DataFrame

    rowNames::Vector{String} = sort(unique(rowVect))
    colNames::Vector{String} = sort(unique(colVect))
    pairs::Vector{Tuple{String, String}} = collect(zip(rowVect, colVect))
    pairsCounts::Dict{Tuple{String, String}, Int} = getCounts(pairs)
	labels::String = "â†“" * rowLabel * "/" * colLabel * "â†’"
    df::Dfs.DataFrame = Dfs.DataFrame()
    columns::Dict{String, Vector{Int}} = Dict()

    for cn in colNames
        columns[cn] = [get(pairsCounts, (rn, cn), 0) for rn in rowNames]
    end

    df = Dfs.DataFrame(columns)
    Dfs.insertcols!(df, 1, labels => rowNames)

    return df
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Here, as we often do, we start by declaring some of the helpful variables.
`rowNames` and `colNames` contain all the possible unique groups for each input
variable (`rowVect` and `colVect`). Then we get all the consecutive pairings
that are in the data by using `zip` and `collect` functions. For instance
`collect(zip(["a", "a", "b"], ["x", "y", "x"]))` will yield us the following
vector of tuples: `[("a", "x"), ("a", "y"), ("b", "x")]`. The pairs are then
sent to `getCounts` (from @sec:statistics_prob_theor_practice) to find out how
often a given pair occurs.

In the next step we define a variable `df` (for now it is empty) to hold our
final result. We saw in @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test that a data frame can
be created by sending a dictionary to the `Dfs.DataFrame` function. Therefore,
we declare `columns` (a dictionary) that will hold the count for every column of
our contingency table.

We fill the columns one by one with `for cn in colNames` loop. To get a count
for a particular row of a given column (`(rn, cn)`) we use `get` function that
extracts it from `pairsCounts`. If the key is not there (a given combination of
`(rn, cn)` does not exist) we return `0` as a default value. We fill columns by
using comprehensions (see @sec:julia_language_comprehensions).

Finally, we put our counts (`columns`) into the data frame (`df`). Now, we
insert a column with `rowNames` at position `1` (first column from left) with
`Dfs.insertcols!`.

All that it is left to do is to return the result.

Let's find out how our `getContingencyTable` works.

```jl
s = """
smokersByProfession = getContingencyTable(
	smoker,
	profession,
	"smoker",
	"profession"
)
Options(smokersByProfession, caption="Number of smokers by profession (fictitious data).", label="smokersByProfession")
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("Options.*") => "")
```

It appears to work just fine. Let's swap the inputs and see if we get a
consistent result.

```jl
s = """
smokersByProfessionTransposed = getContingencyTable(
	profession,
	smoker,
	"profession",
	"smoker"
)
Options(smokersByProfessionTransposed, caption="Number of smokers by profession transposed (fictitious data).", label="smokersByProfessionTransposed")
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("Options.*") => "")
```

Looks good. And now for the small data set with possible zeros.


```jl
s = """
smokersByProfessionSmall = getContingencyTable(
	smokerSmall,
	professionSmall,
	"smoker",
	"profession"
)
Options(smokersByProfessionSmall, caption="Number of smokers by profession (small data set, fictitious data).", label="smokersByProfessionSmall")
"""
replace(sco(s), Regex("Options.*") => "")
```

Seems to be OK as well. Of course we can use this function with a data frame,
e.g. `getContingencyTable(df[!, "col1"], df[!, "col2"], "col1", "col2")` or
adopt it slightly to take a data frame as an input.

### Solution to Exercise 2 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex2_solution}

OK, the most direct solution to the problem (for `getColPerc`) would be
something like

```jl
s = """
function getColPerc(m::Matrix{Int})::Matrix{Float64}
    nRows, nCols = size(m)
    percentages:: Matrix{Float64} = zeros(nRows, nCols)
    for c in 1:nCols
        for r in 1:nRows
            percentages[r, c] = m[r, c] / sum(m[:, c])
            percentages[r, c] = round(percentages[r, c] * 100, digits = 2)
        end
    end
    return percentages
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Here, we begin by extracting the number of rows (`nRows`) and columns
(`nCols`). We use them right away by defining `percentages` matrix that will hold our
final result (for now it is filled with 0s). Then we use the classical [nested
for
loops](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia/Controlling_the_flow#Nested_loops)
idiom to calculate the percentage for every cell in the matrix/table (we use
array indexing we met in @sec:julia_arrays). For that we divide each count
(`m[r, c]`) by column sum (`sum(m[:, c])`). Next, we multiply it by 100 (`*
100`) to change the decimal to percentage. We round the percentage to two
decimal points (`round` and `digits = 2`).

The algorithm is not super efficient (we calculate `sum(m[:, c])` separately for
every cell) or terse (9 lines of code). Still, it is pretty clear and for small
matrices (a few/several rows/cols, that we expect in our input) does the trick.

OK, let's move to the `getRowPerc` function.

```jl
s = """
function getRowPerc(m::Matrix{Int})::Matrix{Float64}
    nRows, nCols = size(m)
    percentages:: Matrix{Float64} = zeros(nRows, nCols)
    for c in 1:nCols
        for r in 1:nRows
            percentages[r, c] = m[r, c] / sum(m[r, :])
            percentages[r, c] = round(percentages[r, c] * 100, digits = 2)
        end
    end
    return percentages
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Hmm, it's almost identical to `getColPerc` (`sum(m[:, c])` was replaced with
`sum(m[r, :])`). Let's remove the code duplication and put it into a single
function.

```jl
s = """
function getPerc(m::Matrix{Int}, byRow::Bool)::Matrix{Float64}
    nRows, nCols = size(m)
    percentages:: Matrix{Float64} = zeros(nRows, nCols)
	dimSum::Int = 0 # sum in a given dimension of a matrix
    for c in 1:nCols
        for r in 1:nRows
			dimSum = (byRow ? sum(m[r, :]) : sum(m[:, c]))
            percentages[r, c] = m[r, c] / dimSum
            percentages[r, c] = round(percentages[r, c] * 100, digits = 2)
        end
    end
    return percentages
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Here, we replaced the function specific sums with a more general `dimSum`
(initialized with 0). Then inside the inner for loop we decide which sum to
compute (row sum with `sum(m[r, :])` and column sum with `sum(m[:, c])`) with a
ternary expression from @sec:ternary_expression. OK, enough of tweaking and code
optimization, let's test our new function.

```jl
s = """
mEyeColor
"""
sco(s)
```

And now column percentages

```jl
s = """
eyeColorColPerc = getPerc(mEyeColor, false)
eyeColorColPerc
"""
sco(s)
```

So, based on the data in `mEyeColor` we see that in the `uk` (first column)
there is roughly `jl eyeColorColPerc[1, 1]`% of people
with blue eyes. Whereas in the `us` (second column) there is roughly
 `jl eyeColorColPerc[1, 2]`% of people with that eye color.

And now for the row percentages.

```jl
s = """
eyeColorRowPerc = getPerc(mEyeColor, true)
eyeColorRowPerc
"""
sco(s)
```

So, based on the data in `mEyeColor` we see that among the investigated groups
roughly `jl eyeColorRowPerc[1, 1]`% of blue eyed people live in the `uk` and
 `jl eyeColorRowPerc[1, 2]`% of blue eyed people live in the `us`.

OK, let's just quickly make sure our function also works fine for a bigger
table.

```jl
s = """
mEyeColorFull
"""
sco(s)
```

And now column percentages.

```jl
s = """
eyeColorColPercFull = getPerc(mEyeColorFull, false)
eyeColorColPercFull
"""
sco(s)
```

So, based on the data in `mEyeColor` we see that in the `uk` (first column)
there is roughly:

- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[1, 1]`% of people with blue eyes,
- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[2, 1]`% of people with green eyes, and
- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[3, 1]`% of people with brown eyes.

For `us` (second column) we got:

- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[1, 2]`% of people with blue eyes,
- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[2, 2]`% of people with green eyes, and
- `jl eyeColorColPercFull[3, 2]`% of people with brown eyes.

Of course, remember that this is all fictitious data inspired by the lecture of
[this Wikipedia's page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color).

OK, enough for the task solution. If you want to see a more terse (and
mysterious) version of `getPerc` then go to [this chapter's code
snippets](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/RJ_BS_eng/tree/main/code_snippets/ch06).

### Solution to Exercise 3 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex3_solution}

OK, the most straightforward way to draw a stacked bar plot would be to use
`Cmk.barplot` with `stack` and `color` [keyword
arguments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Keyword-Arguments).

The solution below is slightly different. It allows for greater control over the
output and it was created after some try and error.

```jl
s = """
import CairoMakie as Cmk

function drawColPerc(df::Dfs.DataFrame,
    dfColLabel::String,
    dfRowLabel::String,
    title::String,
    dfRowColors::Vector{String})::Cmk.Figure

    m::Matrix{Int} = Matrix{Int}(df[:, 2:end])
    columnPerc::Matrix{Float64} = getPerc(m, false)
    nRows, nCols = size(columnPerc)
    colNames::Vector{String} = names(df)[2:end]
    rowNames::Vector{String} = df[1:end, 1]
    xs::Vector{Int} = collect(1:nCols)
    offsets::Vector{Float64} = zeros(nCols)
    curPerc::Vector{Float64} = []
    barplots = []

    fig = Cmk.Figure()
    Cmk.Axis(fig[1, 1],
        title=title,
        xlabel=dfColLabel, ylabel="% of data",
        xticks=(xs, colNames),
		yticks=0:10:100)

    for r in 1:nRows
        curPerc = columnPerc[r, :]
        push!(barplots,
            Cmk.barplot!(fig[1, 1], xs, curPerc,
                offset=offsets, color=dfRowColors[r]))
        offsets = offsets .+ curPerc
    end
    Cmk.Legend(fig[1, 2], barplots, rowNames, dfRowLabel)

    return fig
end
"""
sc(s)
```

We begin by defining a few helpful variables. Most of them are pretty self
explanatory and rely on the constructs we met before. The three most enigmatic
are `offsets`, `curPerc`, and `barplots`.

`offsets` are the locations on Y-axis
where the bottom edges of the bars will be drawn (it is initialized with
zeros). `curPerc` will contain heights of the bars to be drawn.
`barplots` will contain a vector of
bar plot objects drawn (it is necessary for adding proper legend with
`Cmk.Legend`). For each row in `columnPerc` (`for r in 1:nRows`) we take the
percentage of the row and put it into `curPerc`. Then we draw bars
(`Cmk.barplot!`)  of that height that start (their bottom edges) at `offsets`
and are of a color of our choosing (`dfRowColors[r]`). The list of allowed named
colors can be found
[here](https://juliagraphics.github.io/Colors.jl/stable/namedcolors/). We append
the drawn bars to the `bars` vector by using
[push!](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/#Base.push!) function
(we met it in @sec:functions_modifying_arguments). Then we add `curPerc` to the
offset so that the bottom edges of the next bars will start where the top edges
of the previous bars ended.

Once the for loop ended we finish by adding the appropriate legend.

OK, time to test our function

```jl
s = """
drawColPerc(dfEyeColorFull, "Country", "Eye color",
    "Eye Color distribution by country (column percentages)",
    ["lightblue1", "seagreen3", "peachpuff3"])
"""
sc(s)
```

![Eye color distribution by country (column percentages, fictitious data).](./images/ch06ex3v1.png){#fig:ch06ex3v1}

I don't know about you but to me it looks pretty nice.

OK, now we could write `drawRowPerc` function by modifying our `drawColPerc`
slightly. Finally, after some try and error we could write `drawPerc` function
that combines both those functionalities and reduces code duplication. Without
further ado let me fast forward to the definition of `drawPerc`

```jl
s = """
function drawPerc(df::Dfs.DataFrame, byRow::Bool,
    dfColLabel::String,
    dfRowLabel::String,
    title::String,
    groupColors::Vector{String})::Cmk.Figure

    m::Matrix{Int} = Matrix{Int}(df[:, 2:end])
    dimPerc::Matrix{Float64} = getPerc(m, byRow)
    nRows, nCols = size(dimPerc)
    colNames::Vector{String} = names(df)[2:end]
    rowNames::Vector{String} = df[1:end, 1]
    ylabel::String = "% of data"
    xlabel::String = (byRow ? dfRowLabel : dfColLabel)
    xs::Vector{Int} = collect(1:nCols)
    yticks::Tuple{Vector{Int},Vector{String}} = (
        collect(0:10:100), map(string, 0:10:100)
    )
    xticks::Tuple{Vector{Int},Vector{String}} = (xs, colNames)

    if byRow
        nRows, nCols = nCols, nRows
        xs = collect(1:nCols)
        colNames, rowNames = rowNames, colNames
        dfColLabel, dfRowLabel = dfRowLabel, dfColLabel
        xlabel, ylabel = ylabel, xlabel
        yticks, xticks = (xs, colNames), yticks
    end

    offsets::Vector{Float64} = zeros(nCols)
    curPerc::Vector{Float64} = []
    barplots = []

    fig = Cmk.Figure()
    Cmk.Axis(fig[1, 1],
        title=title,
        xlabel=xlabel, ylabel=ylabel,
        xticks=xticks,
        yticks=yticks)

    for r in 1:nRows
        curPerc = (byRow ? dimPerc[:, r] : dimPerc[r, :])
        push!(barplots,
            Cmk.barplot!(fig[1, 1], xs, curPerc,
                offset=offsets, color=groupColors[r],
                direction=(byRow ? :x : :y)))
        offsets = offsets .+ curPerc
    end
    Cmk.Legend(fig[1, 2], barplots, rowNames, dfRowLabel)

    return fig
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Ok, let's see how it works.

```jl
s = """
drawPerc(dfEyeColorFull, true,
    "Country", "Eye color",
    "Eye Color distribution by country (row percentages)",
    ["red", "blue"])
"""
sc(s)
```

![Eye color distribution by country (row percentages, fictitious data).](./images/ch06ex3v2.png){#fig:ch06ex3v2}

Pretty, pretty, pretty.

I leave the code in `drawPerc` for you to decipher. Let me just explain a few
new pieces.

In Julia (like in Python) we can define two variables in one go by using the
following syntax: `a, b = 1, 2` (now `a = 1` and `b = 2`). Let's say that later
in our program we decided that from now on `a` should be `2`, and `b` should be
`1`. We can swap the variables using the following one line expression:
`a, b = b, a`.

Additionally, `drawPerc` makes use of the `direction` keyword argument that
accepts [symbols](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Core.Symbol) `:x`
or `:y`. It made the output slightly more visually pleasing but also marginally
complicated the code. Anyway, `direction = :y` draws vertical bars (see
@fig:ch06ex3v1), whereas `direction = :x` draws horizontal bars (see
@fig:ch06ex3v2).

And that's it for this exercise.

### Solution to Exercise 4 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex4_solution}

OK, let's start by defining helper functions that we will use to test the
assumptions.

```jl
s = """
function isSumAboveCutoff(m::Matrix{Int}, cutoff::Int = 49)::Bool

sc(s)
```

There is not much to explain here, since all we did was to gather the
functionality we had developed in the previous chapters (e.g. in
@sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test).

And now for the tests.

```jl
s = """
function runFisherExactTestGetPVal(m::Matrix{Int})::Float64
    @assert (size(m) == (2, 2)) "input matrix must be of size (2, 2)"
    a, c, b, d = m
    return Htests.FisherExactTest(a, b, c, d) |> Htests.pvalue
end

function runCategTestGetPVal(m::Matrix{Int})::Float64
    @assert (size(m) == (2, 2)) "input matrix must be of size (2, 2)"
    if areChiSq2AssumptionsOK(m)
        return Htests.ChisqTest(m) |> Htests.pvalue
    else
        return runFisherExactTestGetPVal(m)
    end
end

function runCategTestGetPVal(df::Dfs.DataFrame)::Float64
    @assert (size(df) == (2, 3)) "input df must be of size (2, 3)"
    return runCategTestGetPVal(Matrix{Int}(df[:, 2:3]))
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Again, all we did here was to collect the proper functionality we had developed in this
chapter (@sec:compare_categ_data) and its sub-chapters. Therefore, I'll refrain
myself from comments. Instead let's test our newly developed tools.

```jl
s = """
round.(
	[
		runCategTestGetPVal(mEyeColor),
		runCategTestGetPVal(mEyeColorSmall),
		runCategTestGetPVal(dfEyeColor)
	],
	digits = 4
)
"""
sco(s)
```

The functions appear to be working as intended, and the obtained p-values match
those from @sec:compare_categ_data_chisq_test and
@sec:compare_categ_data_fisher_exact_text.

### Solution to Exercise 5 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex5_solution}

Let's start by writing a function that will accept a data frame like
`dfEyeColorFull` and return all the possible 2x2 data frames (2 rows and 2
columns with counts).

```jl
s = """
# previously (ch05) defined function
function getUniquePairs(names::Vector{T})::Vector{Tuple{T,T}} where T
    @assert (length(names) >= 2) "the input must be of length >= 2"
    uniquePairs::Vector{Tuple{T,T}} =
        Vector{Tuple{T,T}}(undef, binomial(length(names), 2))
    currInd::Int = 1
    for i in eachindex(names)[1:(end-1)]
        for j in eachindex(names)[(i+1):end]
            uniquePairs[currInd] = (names[i], names[j])
            currInd += 1
        end
    end
    return uniquePairs
end

function get2x2Dfs(biggerDf::Dfs.DataFrame)::Vector{Dfs.DataFrame}
    nRows, nCols = size(biggerDf)
    @assert ((nRows > 2) || (nCols > 3)) "matrix of counts must be > 2x2"
    rPairs::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}} = getUniquePairs(collect(1:nRows))
	# counts start from column 2
    cPairs::Vector{Tuple{Int, Int}} = getUniquePairs(collect(2:nCols))
    return [
        biggerDf[[r...], [1, c...]] for r in rPairs for c in cPairs
    ]
end
"""
sc(s)
```

We begin by copying and pasting `getUniquePairs` from
@sec:compare_contin_data_ex4_solution. We will use it in `get2x2Dfs`. First we
get unique pairs of rows (`rPairs`). Then we get unique pairs of columns
(`cPairs`). Finally, using nested comprehension and indexing (for reminder see
@sec:julia_arrays and @sec:compare_contin_data_paired_ttest) we get the vector
of all possible 2x2 data frames (actually 2x3 data frames, because first column
contains row labels). Since each element of `rPairs` (`r`) or `cPairs` (`c`) is
a tuple, and indexing must be a vector, then we convert one into the other using
`[r...]` and `[c...]` syntax (e.g. `[(1, 2)...]` will give us `[1, 2]`). In the
end we get the list of data frames as a result.

OK, let's write a function to compute p-values (for now unadjusted) for
data frames in a vector.

```jl
s = """
function runCategTestsGetPVals(
    biggerDf::Dfs.DataFrame
	)::Tuple{Vector{Dfs.DataFrame}, Vector{Float64}}

    overallPVal::Float64 = Htests.ChisqTest(
        Matrix{Int}(biggerDf[:, 2:end])) |> Htests.pvalue
    if (overallPVal <= 0.05)
        dfs::Vector{Dfs.DataFrame} = get2x2Dfs(biggerDf)
        pvals::Vector{Float64} = runCategTestGetPVal.(dfs)
        return (dfs, pvals)
    else
        return ([biggerDf], [overallPVal])
    end
end
"""
sc(s)
```

The function is rather simple. First, it checks the overall p-value
(`overallPVal`) for the `biggerDf`. If it is less than or equal to our customary
cutoff level ($\alpha = 0.05$) then we execute `runCategTestGetPVal` on each
possible data frame (`dfs`) using the dot operator syntax from
@sec:julia_language_dot_functions. We return a tuple, its first element is a
vector of data frames, its second element is a vector of corresponding
(uncorrected) p-values. If `overallPVal` is greater than the cutoff level then
we place our `biggerDf` and its corresponding p-value (`overallPVal`) into
vectors, and place them into a tuple (which is returned).

Time to test our function.

```jl
s = """
resultCategTests = runCategTestsGetPVals(dfEyeColorFull)
resultCategTests[1]
"""
sco(s)
```

Looking good, and now the corresponding unadjusted p-values.

```jl
s = """
resultCategTests[2]
"""
sco(s)
```

Once we got it, adjusting the p-values should be a breeze.

```jl
s = """
import MultipleTesting as Mt

function adjustPVals(
    multCategTestsResults::Tuple{Vector{Dfs.DataFrame}, Vector{Float64}},
    multCorr::Type{<:Mt.PValueAdjustment}
	)::Tuple{Vector{Dfs.DataFrame}, Vector{Float64}}
	dfs, pvals = multCategTestsResults
    adjPVals::Vector{Float64} = Mt.adjust(pvals, multCorr())
    return (dfs, adjPVals)
end
"""
sc(s)
```

Yep. All we did here, was to extract the vector of p-values (`pvals`) and send
it as an argument to `Mt.adjust` for correction. Let's see how it works (since
we are using the `Bonferroni` method then we expect the adjusted p-values to be
3x greater than the unadjusted ones, see
@sec:compare_contin_data_multip_correction).

```jl
s = """
resultAdjustedCategTests = adjustPVals(resultCategTests, Mt.Bonferroni)
resultAdjustedCategTests[2]
"""
sco(s)
```

OK, it appears to be working just fine.

### Solution to Exercise 6 {#sec:compare_categ_data_ex6_solution}

OK, let's look at an exemplary solution.

```jl
s = """
function drawColPerc2(
    biggerDf::Dfs.DataFrame,
    dfColLabel::String,
    dfRowLabel::String,
    title::String,
    dfRowColors::Dict{String,String},
    alpha::Float64=0.05,
    adjMethod::Type{<:Mt.PValueAdjustment}=Mt.Bonferroni)::Cmk.Figure

    multCategTests::Tuple{
        Vector{Dfs.DataFrame},
        Vector{Float64}} = runCategTestsGetPVals(biggerDf)
    multCategTests = adjustPVals(multCategTests, adjMethod)
    dfs, pvals = multCategTests

    fig = Cmk.Figure(resolution=(800, 400 * length(dfs)))

    for i in eachindex(dfs)
        m::Matrix{Int} = Matrix{Int}(dfs[i][:, 2:end])
        columnPerc::Matrix{Float64} = getPerc(m, false)
        nRows, nCols = size(columnPerc)
        colNames::Vector{String} = names(dfs[i])[2:end]
        rowNames::Vector{String} = dfs[i][1:end, 1]
        xs::Vector{Int} = collect(1:nCols)
        offsets::Vector{Float64} = zeros(nCols)
        curPerc::Vector{Float64} = []
        barplots = []

        Cmk.Axis(fig[i, 1],
            title=title,
            xlabel=dfColLabel, ylabel="% of data",
            xticks=(xs, colNames),
            yticks=0:10:100)

        for r in 1:nRows
            curPerc = columnPerc[r, :]
            push!(barplots,
                Cmk.barplot!(fig[i, 1], xs, curPerc,
                    offset=offsets,
                    color=get(dfRowColors, rowNames[r], "black"),
                    strokewidth=(pvals[i] <= alpha) ? 2 : 0))
            offsets = offsets .+ curPerc
        end
        Cmk.Legend(fig[i, 2], barplots, rowNames, dfRowLabel)
    end

    return fig
end
"""
sc(s)
```

The function definition differs slightly from the original `drawColPerc`. Of
note we changed the `colors` parameter from `Vector{String}` to `Dict{String,
String}` (a mapping between row name in column 1 and color by which it will be
represented on the graph). Of course, we added two more parameters `alpha` and
`adjMethod`.

First, we run multiple categorical tests (`runCategTestsGetPVals`) and adjust
the obtained p-values (`adjustPVals`) using functionality developed earlier
(@sec:compare_categ_data_ex5_solution). Then we, define the figure object with a
desired resolution (`resolution=(widthPixels, heightPixels)`) adjusted by number
of subplots in the figure (`* length(dfs)`).

The next step is pretty simple, basically we enclose the previously developed
code from `drawColPerc` in a for loop (`for i in eachindex(dfs)`) that draws
consecutive data frames as a stacked bar plots in a separate rows of the
figure. If a statistically significant difference for a data frame was detected
(`pvals[i] <= alpha`) we add a stroke (`strokewidth`) to the bar plot.

Time to see how it works.

```
drawColPerc2(dfEyeColorFull, "Country", "Eye color", "Eye color by country",
    Dict("blue" => "lightblue1",
        "green" => "seagreen3",
        "brown" => "peachpuff3"))
```

![Eye color distribution by country (column percentages, fictitious data). Stroke denotes statistically significant difference (p $\leq$ 0.05).](./images/ch06ex6.png){#fig:ch06ex6}

It looks quite OK + it allows us to quickly judge which eye colors distributions
differ one from another. For a more complicated layout we should probably follow
the guidelines contained in the [Layout
Tutorial](https://docs.makie.org/stable/tutorials/layout-tutorial/).
