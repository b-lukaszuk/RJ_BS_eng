Hello there. This is an open source/access book entitled: "Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is Basic Statistics".
So I guess it's gonna be about [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and its usage for basic statistics.

This book was generated using [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl) starting with [BooksTemplate](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/BookTemplate).

For now this book has no **PDF** file (maybe I'll add it later).

For now the template for this book can be found [here](https://github.com/b-lukaszuk/julia_luzne_zadanka/tree/main/experiment1).

The book is available under [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license. It was written by a Julia enthusiast for any curious readers, however it comes with no warranties whatsoever (see the license). Still, I wish you a pleasant and fruitful reading.
